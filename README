Name: Richard Kaye
Program: modbus_client
This application is required as part of the assesment for my undergraduate studies in Electronic Engineering at Victoria University.

The application has been written using GENTOO GNU/Linux distribution

The application will simultaneously operate as a Modbus server and a Bacnet client.
The Modbus server is located with an IP address of 140.159.153.159 on port 502.
The Bacnet client is located with an IP address of 140.159.160.7 on port 0xBAC0.
  The unique Bacnet Device ID numbers used to prevent conflict are 52 and 53
 
The Bacnet client will continually send Who_Is requests every second to device 52 until it is found, when found the application will respond with an I_Am from device 52. Then the Bacnet client will send Read_Property requests for 2 instances at 100ms intervals.

The Autotools build system had been used for this application.
To use the application clone the complete repository from Github using
        git@github.com:richard-kaye/EES4100_Bridge.git
  then type
	./bootstrap.sh
	./configure
	make

To run the application go to the /src folder and type:
	./modbus_client
